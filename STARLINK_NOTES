This is GNU libtool 1.5 with a couple of patches.

There are no functional changes to libtool as such, however, it has
also had component.xml added to it, and it has had its Makefile.in's
modified by the automake patched for Starlink.  The procedure for that
is:
    
    rm missing
    aclocal
    automake --add-missing      # Adds patched `missing'
    autoconf
    ./configure --prefix=/export3/sun/buildsupport
    make
    install-manifest
