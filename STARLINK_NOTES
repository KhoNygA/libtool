This is GNU libtool 1.5 with a couple of patches.

There are no functional changes to libtool as such, however, it has
also had component.xml added to it, and it has had its Makefile.in's
modified by the automake patched for Starlink.  With the _Starlink_
autotools in the path, the procedure for updating that, after an
import of a new libtool version, is:
    
    rm missing
    aclocal  # probably redundant, but does no harm
    autoreconf --install --symlink

(then ./configure;make;make install should work as usual)
