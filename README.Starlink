This is GNU libtool 1.5 with a couple of patches.

There are no functional changes to libtool as such, however it has
also had component.xml{,.in} added to it, and it has had its
Makefile.in files modified by the automake patched for Starlink.  

For discussion of how to import new versions, see
thirdparty/fsf/README.Starlink
