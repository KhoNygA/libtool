This is GNU libtool 1.5 with a couple of patches.

There are no functional changes to libtool as such, however it has
also had component.xml{,.in} added to it, and it has had its
Makefile.in files modified by the automake patched for Starlink.

Libtool appears to have some rather intricate dependencies.  The
checkout-fixup target mentioned in BUILT_SOURCES attempts to touch
these up-to-date, but I'm not positive it succeeds reliably.  That
they're working now might just be because all the generated files were
committed later than the files they're generated from.

./libltdl/libtool fails with ksh (the chosen shell on DUX), because
the bug breaks a check that happens to be redundant in this context.
I commented out the corresponding line in libltdl/ltmain.sh, in such a
way that it should cause a conflict when a (working?) next version of
libtool is imported.
